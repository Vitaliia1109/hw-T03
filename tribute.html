          Born February 21, 1946, in West London, England, Alan Rickman showed
          an early penchant for the performing arts. He cut his teeth as an
          actor in 1978, when he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. He earned
          a Tony Award nomination as the star of 1988's Les Liaisons
          Dangereuses, then came to American consciousness that same year as
          terrorist Hans Gruber in the big-screen blockbuster Die Hard. His film
          credits include the notable Harry Potter series, as well as Tim
          Burton's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) and
          Alice in Wonderland (2010). Rickman died of cancer on January 14,
          2016.
